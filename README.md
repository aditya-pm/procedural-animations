# Procedural Animations

A small playground for experimenting with **procedural animation techniques**.

This repository is meant to be a growing collection of simple, self-contained
procedural animation demos, implemented in C++.

Each demo focuses on **one idea at a time** (constraints, oscillation, IK, noise, etc.)
and is designed to be easy to read, modify, and extend.


## Current Status
Work in progress  
Right now this project is in an early stage.  
The structure and core loop are being set up before adding full demos.


## Goals

- Learn procedural animation from first principles
- Keep each animation simple and isolated
- Avoid pre-baked animations or keyframes
- Build a clean, extensible demo framework


## Planned Techniques

Some of the techniques that will be explored:

- Follow chains & distance constraints
- Sine / oscillation-based motion (snakes, tails)
- Inverse kinematics (IK)
- Physics-based motion (Verlet integration)
- Noise-driven motion
- Flocking / group behavior


## Building (placeholder)

Build instructions will be added once the first demo is implemented.
